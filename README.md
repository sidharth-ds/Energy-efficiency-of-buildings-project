### Target variables:
   * The heating load (y1) is the amount of heat energy that would **need to be added** to a space to maintain the temperature in an acceptable range. 
   * The cooling load (y2) is the amount of heat energy that would **need to be removed** from a space (cooling) to maintain the temperature in an acceptable range.
    
### Features:
    * X1 - Relative Compactness
    * X2 - Surface Area
    * X3 - Wall Area
    * X4 - Roof Area
    * X5 - Overall Height
    * X6 - Orientation
    * X7 - Glazing Area
